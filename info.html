    This website was created by me darren skerrett.
    The website is hosted at https://skerrett.github.io
    All work is my own no bootstrap templates used*</h1>
    <h2>Features</h2>
<p>At the top of the page you will see a navbar with links to all the heading of the site.
    The navbar is accompanied by a search bar that will search google.
    This navbar collapses when the page is made smaller.
    The next funtionality i added was a type writer that works in a loop starting at i am darren
    and goes through some statements until it repeats. </p>
    <p>Next is a button to download my cv. since the page is static no download takes place but a message is shown to show success.
    Next is a contact me button which opens a modal with a form to contact. All fields must be filled out, afterwards a success message is shown.
    The about me section is styled using bootstraps colunms.
        <p>
    Next is a fixed image the shows more as you scroll, this was done using css (background: url(img/Fixed.jpg) no-repeat center center fixed;)
    Next is my professional skills. I showcased this using progression bars and css styling.
    The Next Section is Education. I used a carousel to show off my education section.
    The carousel goes through my 3 stages of education and will stop changing when the user hovers over the section
    below the user can select there chosen slide also.
    Each image can be clicked and the user will be brought to that schools/colleges site.
</p>
<p>
    Next are my college grades i saw this idea from a bootsnippet site :https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/868DQ
    I thought this idea could be reworked to show grades.
    The user is presented with 4 colunms and each colunm has a data tab that changes the semester for that year.
    Next is my Portfolio which when the image is clicked will show more information about the image and alow the user to hit next or pervious to move on to the next image.
    below each image is a button that will redirect to github (where possible)
    The next section is a Work and achievement timeline this idea came from a bootsnipet found here: https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/Q0ppE
    This section uses css to connect lines between years to create a timeline effect.
</p>
    The Next Section is a Testimonials uses owl-theme and css to show Testimonials from my colleages at SAP
    The footer uses a embeded google map and uses fa social media icons.

</p>

<p>The site sizes for mobile and tablet as i took use of bootstraps col system.
    All images(that makes sense and where appropriate) and icons link to one of the following social media / github / website.

    *Snippets used where changed and links to oringinal work were provided.</p>
